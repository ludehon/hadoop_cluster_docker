## Using Docker Compose

Add the following services to your `docker-compose.yml` to integrate a Spark master and Spark worker in [your BDE pipeline](https://github.com/big-data-europe/app-bde-pipeline):
```yml
version: '3'
services:
  spark-master:
    image: bde2020/spark-master:3.3.0-hadoop3.3
    container_name: spark-master
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "7077:7077"
    environment:
      - INIT_DAEMON_STEP=setup_spark
  spark-worker-1:
    image: bde2020/spark-worker:3.3.0-hadoop3.3
    container_name: spark-worker-1
    depends_on:
      - spark-master
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
    environment:
      - "SPARK_MASTER=spark://spark-master:7077"
  spark-worker-2:
    image: bde2020/spark-worker:3.3.0-hadoop3.3
    container_name: spark-worker-2
    depends_on:
      - spark-master
    ports:
      - "8082:8081"
    environment:
      - "SPARK_MASTER=spark://spark-master:7077"
  spark-history-server:
      image: bde2020/spark-history-server:3.3.0-hadoop3.3
      container_name: spark-history-server
      depends_on:
        - spark-master
      ports:
        - "18081:18081"
      volumes:
        - /tmp/spark-events-local:/tmp/spark-events
```
Make sure to fill in the `INIT_DAEMON_STEP` as configured in your pipeline.

## Running Docker containers without the init daemon
### Spark Master
To start a Spark master:

    docker run --name spark-master -h spark-master -d bde2020/spark-master:3.3.0-hadoop3.3

### Spark Worker
To start a Spark worker:

    docker run --name spark-worker-1 --link spark-master:spark-master -d bde2020/spark-worker:3.3.0-hadoop3.3

## Launch a Spark application
Building and running your Spark application on top of the Spark cluster is as simple as extending a template Docker image. Check the template's README for further documentation.
* [Maven template](template/maven)
* [Python template](template/python)
* [Sbt template](template/sbt)

docker build --rm -t bde/spark-app .
docker run --name my-spark-app -e ENABLE_INIT_DAEMON=false --link spark-master:spark-master --net dockerspark_default -d bde/spark-app
